# Beat Coronavirus!

This is a retro-style website game that David Zhan (me) and Michael Liu created for the TitanHacks 2020 Hackthon. It is a game that simulates some common things that should be done in this time, like wearing a mask, buying the correct groceries, and washing your hands. This simulation is designed to teach or remind people of what they need to do. As this game is very kid friendly, it is also a useful tool to teach the little ones some important rules.

As a result of the time limit inherent in a hackathon, we weren't able to implement every single one of our ideas. However, all the ideas that we did end up implementing works great. In the future, we plan on adding many more levels and activities to practice more protective measures.

We hope you enjoy our project!
