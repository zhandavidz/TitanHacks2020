        <h3>1) Stay home as much as you can</h3>
        
        <p>By staying home, you can prevent the overall contact of people to keep both yourself and others safe from the coronavirus.</p>
        

        <h3>2) Keep a safe distance</h3>
        
        <p>When needed to go outside, it is important to keep at least a 6 feet (2 meter) distance from everyone around you to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
        

        <h3>3) Wash your hands often</h3>
        
        <p>Washing your hands is usually looked over, but is actually very important. Your hands make contact with thousands of surfaces every day and touches your face hundreds of times. By washing your hands you can prevent the spread of germs from your surroundings.</p>
        

        <h3>4) Cover your cough</h3>
        
        <p>Even though you may not have the coronavirus it is important to always cover your cough just in case. Cough within your elbow and try to look away from others.</p>
        

        <h3>5) Sick? Call ahead</h3>
        
        <p>If you notice any symptoms or any signs of the coronavirus, make sure to call in to the hospital to take early preventive measures against the virus.</p>
